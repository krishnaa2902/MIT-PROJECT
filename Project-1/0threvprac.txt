cross side scripting attack is a type of injection attack where malicious scripts are injected in trusted websites, executed by the user's browser.

impact
when an attacker injects malicious code the browser will be tricked into thinking that the script is actually from a trusted source and this will execute the script leading to severe vulnerabilites including attackers gaining access to cookies and session tokens.
This would enable them to grant login access and steal credentials, authorise unwanted payments, redirect users to look alike websites (aka phishing attack) and more...

an attacker could change the way your webpage looks for instance he could inject a html form with the form action attribute set to the addrerss of his server this stealing credentials from the user.

an attacker could also register and send the users key strokes to his server with the help of an event listner that makes a note of the key strokes of the user.


XSS DOM 

payload is executed as a result of modifying the dom

DOM-based XSS attacks target the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The DOM represents the structure of a web page as a tree-like structure of objects that can be manipulated using JavaScript. In a DOM-based XSS attack, the attacker exploits the way the web application processes user inputs and generates dynamic content within the DOM.
